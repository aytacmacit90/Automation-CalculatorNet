# Automation-CalculatorNet

In this project we will try create effective automation scripts for "Calculator.Net" type of websites.

You can visit website and see website has a lot of different calculation functions. In phase 1.x we will focus on BMI(Body-Mass Index) we will try every function in this function as much as possible. You can check the script and you can improve it with new ideas.

You can reach me via email for asking more details or help or whatever you need to ask :)
